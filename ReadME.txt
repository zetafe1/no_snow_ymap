Process:

- always use the seamless image from: SNOW_REMOVE.ytd
you will need only to rename this file!

- on Codex search for snowcov-xmas & the equivalent for snowcov-xmas-secondary
lets make example with this files like in the video: snowcov-xmas-121 & snowcov-xmas-secondary-121

Get the snowcov-xmas-secondary-121.ytd and export the texture.dds 

Edit it with paint.net
- where you don't want snow: paint it in **BLACK** color
There are many pixels on this image so you can zoom in very well on buildings or areas that you want to clean;
Make a bigger area than the building area otherwise you can have snow inside/near walls
Play around in any more natural ways.. how you wish :)

Save this edited file as png with paint.net
Go in codex and upload the new texture with option dx1/bc1 generate mips active.
Then, on codex go to the detail window of this file and you must edit the miplevels from 8 to 1
Also edit the VFT (also on details) from 0 to this: 5378212016 (probably game wont load this VFT detail but make it this way)
Save it with the name you will need: example snowcov-xmas-secondary-121.ytd

Close codex, open it again so it updates the new files, check if miplevels are set to 1 and VFT 5378212016 and if all is correct

Put both files snow_remove_renamed.ytd + snowcov-xmas-secondary-numer.ytd (eg:snowcov-xmas-121 & snowcov-xmas-secondary-121) on your streaming resource and tha's it! 
No snow coverage in this area!

If you want to try out before, use the tutorial edited files before. Place them on your stream resource on go check Emerald Ranch!
